# SRMIST-Codes-Official

Welcome to **SRMIST-Codes-Official**, the official coding repository for students of **SRM Institute of Science and Technology (SRMIST)**. Our mission is to create a comprehensive resource for **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)**, **Design and Analysis of Algorithms (DAA)**, coding problems, interview questions, and everything related to coding.

This organization is designed to help students from all branches to learn, practice, and improve their coding skills by contributing to various repositories. Whether you are a beginner or an advanced coder, you will find resources, challenges, and code to help you grow.

## Repositories

We have a variety of repositories for different programming languages and topics:

- **C Programming**
  - Data Structures, Algorithms, Competitive Coding
- **C++ Programming**
  - Object-Oriented Programming, DSA, Problem Solving
- **Java Programming**
  - Core Java, Advanced Java, DSA, Coding Practice
- **Python Programming**
  - Scripting, DSA, Machine Learning
- **Interview Preparation**
  - Coding questions and solutions for technical interviews
- **Competitive Programming**
  - Practice problems from various coding platforms (Codeforces, LeetCode, etc.)

## How to Contribute

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone the repository you want to contribute to using `git clone`.
2. **Choose a Problem/Concept**: Pick a coding problem, DSA topic, or algorithm that you want to implement.
3. **Create a Branch**: Always create a new branch for your contributions.
4. **Submit a Pull Request**: After writing the code, submit a pull request. Our team will review and merge it if it meets the guidelines.

## Goals

- To create a robust repository of DSA, DAA, and coding concepts for every student.
- To foster a collaborative environment for coding and learning.
- To help students prepare for technical interviews and coding competitions.

## Code of Conduct

We expect all contributors to adhere to our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) to maintain a healthy and productive community.

## Join Us

Whether you are a student looking to contribute or a teacher guiding students, we welcome everyone to join and contribute to the growth of this organization.
